##Information for Readthedocs
- When creating new files they need to be in rst (ReStructured)
    - Can upload python converter script or just us online site to do conversion from markdown if desired
- Once the rst files are uploaded into the /docs/source file in the github you need to add the file name to the contents of index.rst
- Do a fresh build on readthedocs and check for expected changes
  - If they do not appear:
    - First, download the HTML and check for changes there (sometimes the readthdocs site takes an hour or so to update but HTML source updates automatically)
    - If they are also not listed in the HTML, check the raw for runtime errors/warning
- Known errors/solutions:
  - WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
    - Make sure you listed the file in index.rst within the toctree
  - WARNING: toctree contains reference to document 'EditConfig' that doesn't have a title: no link will be generated
    - Add a title to the top of your rst file. All rst files must have a title for Sphinx to upload them
  - WARNING: Title underline too short.
    - Add required characters beneath title to fully underline the words
