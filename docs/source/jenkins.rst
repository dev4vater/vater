~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

Why is it implemented in VATER?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Jenkins will be used as an automated testing framework to ensure we provide a quality product. In the future, VATER will integrate automated tests for each class deployment. This would allow for the verification of all aspects of the lab environment before it is utilized by the students.
