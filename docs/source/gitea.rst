Getting Started with Gitea
==========================
Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. Gitea is an open-source forge software package for hosting software development version control using Git as well as other collaborative features like bug tracking, wikis and code review. 

Gitea and Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gitea provides automatically updated Docker images within its Docker Hub organization. 
It is possible to always use the latest stable tag or to use another service that handles updating Docker images.

Accessing Gitea 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runs on ``control`` port ``3000``

Gitea holds only one branch of ``rous`` at a time. This branch is named
``master`` in gitea but is identical to ``main`` or any ``issxx`` branch
in the ``rous`` github.
